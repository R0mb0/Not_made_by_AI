## Story of this repository

This project was inspired by the [Not By AI](https://notbyai.fyi/) initiative, which I discovered while searching for a badge to inform people that the content in my repositories was created without the use of AI. However, I chose not to use their badges because I believe they should be included in projects where, [as they encourage](https://notbyai.fyi/how-it-works), the content has been reviewed to ensure that only a minimal portion of the work was created using AI.

As a programmer with limited free time, I am unable to submit my projects and provide detailed descriptions beyond what I have already wrote. For this reason, I decided to create my own badge as a personal challenge and a way to take a break from my main job.

## Common Questions

<div align="left">
<details>
  <summary> 
   
### Why did you use HTML to draw the badge?
  
  </summary>  

I'm not skilled with drawing apps, and I had limited free time to create the badge. (╥﹏╥) So, I preferred to use a familiar tool instead of learning a new one.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Did you use AI to help yourself?
  
  </summary>  

No, I copied, pasted, and personalized code found on the internet. ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ )

### Isn't it much easier to use the badges from [Not By AI](https://notbyai.fyi/)?
  
  </summary>  

No. Creating this entire repository took me about two hours of my free time. Submitting my work to the [register](https://notbyai.fyi/how-it-works) page on the "Not By AI" website would have taken much more time. Also, I prefer that their badges are used only for reviewed works.

### Is this badge proof that the work is human-made and not created by AI?
  
  </summary>  

Anyone can misuse this badge or create their own badge claiming that their work is human-made. Therefore, the presence of this badge is not definitive proof of a human-original work. It ultimately comes down to whether you trust the author.

### Why should I include this badge in my work?
  
  </summary>  

This badge is a form of self-declaration that you put effort into creating your work. It can be seen as a way to celebrate your dedication and hard work.

### What do you think about AI?
  
  </summary>  

I think AI is a fantastic tool for work, but it should not be used as a replacement for the effort required to learn something. I see AI as an assistant to simplify my work, not a tool to delegate my tasks. 

The only way to grow as a person and a professional is to spend time learning and not always look for the easiest way to do everything. Gaining experience is the most important thing. (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)
